<p><strong>Work on as small of a part of the problem as you can at a time</strong></p>
<p>In Jenny Bryan&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan">https://twitter.com/JennyBryan</a>) keynote she had a realyl
insightful point that all the great programmers she has worked with have taken
big scary problems and broke them down to as small of a working example as
they can. They then make sure they undetstand that part and add then begin
adding complexity or moving on to the next piece.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Debt as a social problem</strong></p>
<p>Gordon Shotwell (<a href="https://twitter.com/gshotwell">https://twitter.com/gshotwell</a>) gave a talk about the big
challenges in technical debt being social problems. Some of the takeaways
from this I thought were especially interesting were:</p>
<p>Technical debt tends to arrise from either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not considering all potential use cases</li>
<li>Not having time to implement as robust of solutions as would be ideal</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges to refactoring existing code even when there is bandwidth for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>People get attached to things they make and whoever created the code is likely still working with you</li>
<li>Once people go through the pain of learning to used a flawed thing, they feel attatched to it and forget how difficult learning it was</li>
<li>Learning new ways to do things can be scary</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="r-packagesfunctions-im-excited-about">R packages/functions I&rsquo;m excited about</h2>
<p><strong>purrr::partial</strong></p>
<p>Creates partially filled in functions, so if you need to pass the same argument
to the same function a bunch, this can clean up your code (and let you change
what you are passing to all instances by changing one line.</p>
<p><strong>purrr::compose</strong></p>
<p>Lets you combine functions to simplify your code so of you need to pass
the same series of piped function multiple times then you can use this instead
of repeting yourself over and over.</p>
<p><em>Both of these have good examples in this blog post: <a href="https://colinfay.me/purrr-code-optim/">https://colinfay.me/purrr-code-optim/</a></em></p>
<p><strong>memoix::memoise</strong></p>
<p>This provides some basic caching either locally or in S3. I am excited to see
if this can save time when building reports where I keep knitting it working on
the presentation and layout parts, but it has long queries in it.</p>
<p><strong>vctrs</strong></p>
<p>Build custom vectors, these seem to be similar to classes. The interesting
example from the talk was that he works in historical records which use currencies
that are not in base 10. Using this allowed him to make custom vectors that know<br>
how to do all the math.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong></p>
<p>This can help with code evaluating when there are open cpu cycles instead of
locking up your main thread. I <em>think</em> it might be most usefull for lower level
things that I am currently doing but the concept is neat.</p>
<p><strong>chromatic</strong></p>
<p>Headless chrome browser controlled via R/</p>
<p><strong>sparklr</strong></p>
<p>Spark from R! I get excited about this every year then don&rsquo;t end up really
pursuing it every year.</p>
<p><strong>logger</strong>
This seems generally nice for adding logs to things it could be great it we
start doing more with reports that auto generate at a regular cadence.</p>
<p>Excitingly, there is a one liner for adding logging to your shinny app!</p>
<p><strong>botor</strong></p>
<p>Similar to boto3 but for R, I have never been sure the best way to get to S3
from R so hearing this existed blew my mind.</p>
<p><strong>future</strong></p>
<p>Parallel computing! The idea is that you should be able to write code with
future then the user should decide what machines it is used on. A lot of this
can be done through defults. So using things like <code>furrr::future_map</code> can
give you big speed boosts without any real effort.</p>
<p><strong>progresser</strong></p>
<p>Get progress updates on your parralel jobs (talked about in <code>future</code> talk)</p>
<p><strong>bbplot</strong></p>
<p>BBC style plotting. Mostly interested in seeing how they implemnted it to see
if our work plotting can be made easier.</p>
<p><strong>usethis::ui_&hellip; family</strong></p>
<p><strong>U</strong>ser <strong>I</strong>nterface functions to give stylized feedback to users.</p>
<p>For instance <code>usethis::ui_todo('task')</code> will show &ldquo;task&rdquo; with a red dot next
to it so the user knows steps they need to take. While <code>usethis::ui_done('task')</code>
will show &ldquo;task&rdquo; with a green checkmark to let them know what was done.</p>
<h3 id="other-technologies">Other Technologies</h3>
<p>__Github Actions(<a href="https://github.com/features/actions)__">https://github.com/features/actions)__</a></p>
<p>These can be used to build, test, and deploy code. Triggered by actions within
the repo. So the obvious sort of ones is someone pushing to an app or our
airflow repository and it running checks on it. But there were also some cool
user cases like the Tidyverse has things set up where if someone makes a
documentation change but doesn&rsquo;t rebuild the documentation, a maintainer can
comment <code>/document</code> and it will run a documentation build and commit it to the
branch.</p>
<p>This seeems to be an alternative to Circleci/Jenkins/AppVeyor build tools,
behind the scenes I think it is running Azura pipelines.</p>
<p>The tests and builds can be set up to run on mac, linux (many builds), and
windows, so this is especially helpful for testing packages that have to
interact with filesystems.</p>
<p>Can be setup with: <code>usethis::github_actions()</code>.</p>
<p>There are built in tools for passwords and secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Parquete</strong></p>
<p>I still have a lot to learn about these but they are apparently used commonly
with spark and can save a lot of room and lookup costs over csv if youre
storing/accessing them in S3.</p>
